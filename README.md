# Path Tracer

A CPU-based, naive implementation of the classical path tracer in C++. This algorithm generates rendered images by calculating a solution to the rendering equation using Monte Carlo integration methods.
The renderer is capable of simulating specular reflection, refraction/transparency and uses BVH as an acceleration data structure. A report in Dutch is included.
