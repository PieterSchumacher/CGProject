Goal: Read Wavefront Object, write a .ppm (or other format) image in a perspective

Tasks:
  Camera                        Probably done
  Shape                         Kind of done
  Sphere                        Probably done
  Ray                           Most likely done
  Image file writer
  Wavefront Object parser
  Material
  Plane
  Pixel? Maybe, must ask

Notes:
  Split into subtasks (this might change for the file format):
    1. write a .ppm with random colours
    2. write a sphere with predetermined colours to .ppm
    3. ray trace a sphere and write to .ppm
    4. do 3 for a triangle
    5. parse a simple triangle and write to .ppm
  When the above is finished, then think about lights, phong shading and material model

Questions for assistant:
  Suggestion for image format, prefer an industry standard
  Way to read Wavefront Object files with notepad/any other application program
  Find a way to define a working project structure without h2w lib
  Further explanation on the use of a Pixel data structure, and possible other screen/film related things
