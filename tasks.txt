Goal: Read Wavefront Object, write a .ppm image in a perspective

Tasks:
  Camera                        Probably done
  Shape                         Kind of done
  Sphere                        Probably done
  Ray                           Most likely done
  Wavefront Object parser
  .ppm writer
  Material
  Plane
  Pixel? Maybe

Notes:
  Split into subtasks:
    1. write a .ppm with random colours
    2. write a sphere with predetermined colours to .ppm
    3. ray trace a sphere and write to .ppm
    4. do 3 for a triangle
    5. parse a simple triangle and write to .ppm
  When the above is finished, then think about lights, phong shading and material model
